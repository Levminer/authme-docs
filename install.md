## Mac

Instructions for Mac:

1. Authme is currently available for Mac as an [alpha](https://nightly.link/Levminer/authme/workflows/mac-artifacts/dev/authme-latest-mac-x64-installer-portable.zip) version, because Apple only allows build to Mac from a MacBook. So I can't test if this works or not, but it's should be working.
